# Note-editing chatbot
 
This is an example LLM chatbot for editing notes. It is a Proof of Concept, and does not 100% work as intended. When it does though it's magnificient :)

To get started, create a .env file and insert your OpenAI key.

> "OPENAI_API_KEY" = "your-key-here"

You can create an Obsidian vault in the /alexandria (like the Great Library, that was the name of my vault) folder or change the name of the folder in the main file.
